  abstract = { Wavelength calibration is a necessary first step for a range of applications in spectroscopy. The relationship between wavelength and pixel position on the array detector is approximately governed by a low-order polynomial and traditional wavelength calibration involves first-, second-, and third-order polynomial fitting to the pixel positions of spectral lines from a well known reference lamp such as neon. However, these methods lose accuracy for bands outside of the outermost spectral line in the reference spectrum. We propose a fast and robust wavelength calibration routine based on modeling the optical system that is the spectrometer. For spectral bands within the range of spectral lines of the lamp, we report similar accuracy to second- and third-order fitting. For bands that lie outside of the range of spectral lines, we report an accuracy 12–121 times greater than that of third-order fitting and 2.5–6 times more accurate than second-order fitting. The algorithm is developed for both reflection and transmission spectrometers and tested for both cases. Compared with similar algorithms in the literature that use the physical model of the spectrometer, we search over more physical parameters in shorter time, and obtain superior accuracy. A secondary contribution in this paper is the introduction of new evaluation methods for wavelength accuracy that are superior to traditional evaluation. }

  abstract  = {Nighttime polarimetric measurements are often obtained very close to the limits of the instrumental capabilities. It is important to be aware of the possible sources of spurious polarization, and to adopt data reduction techniques that best compensate for the instrumental effects intrinsic to the design of the most common polarimeters adopted for nighttime observations. We define a self-consistent framework starting from the basic definitions of the Stokes parameters, and we present an analytical description of the data reduction techniques commonly used with a polarimeter (consisting of a retarder wave plate and a Wollaston prism) to explore their advantages and limitations. We first consider an ideal polarimeter in which all optical components are perfectly defined by their nominal characteristics. We then introduce deviations from the nominal behavior of the polarimetric optics, and develop an analytical model to describe the polarization of the outgoing radiation. We study and compare the results of two different data reduction methods, one based on the differences of the signals, and one based on their ratios, to evaluate the residual amount of spurious polarization. We show that data reduction techniques may fully compensate for small deviations of the polarimetric optics from their nominal values, although some important (first-order) corrections have to be adopted for linear polarization data. We include a detailed discussion of quality checking by means of null parameters. We present an application to data obtained with the FORS1 instrument of the ESO VLT, in which we have detected a significant amount of cross talk between circular and linear polarization. We show that this cross-talk effect is not due to the polarimetric optics themselves, but is most likely caused by spurious birefringence due to the instrument's collimator lens.}

The mathematical formalism presented here is based on rotations about three orthogonal axes of the Poincar\'{e} sphere and exploits well-known mathematical properties of coordinate rotation. One result is that a number of identities appear which simplify the functional description of a train of optical components. The technique is extended to include a first-order theory corresponding to that used in geometrical optics.}

  abstract  = {The effects of changes in temperature, wavelength, and direction of propagation (angle of incidence) on the retardance of zero-order, multiple-order, compound zero-order, and temperature-compensated waveplates are described in detail. A disagreement in the literature regarding the properties of a compound zero-order waveplate is resolved by showing that with respect to temperature and wavelength it behaves like a true zero-order waveplate, but with respect to angle of incidence it behaves like a multiple-order waveplate. A previously proposed temperature-compensated design is shown to suffer from the same directional limitations. A new design for a retarder consisting of one element of a positive uniaxial crystal and one element of a negative uniaxial crystal is proposed. The retardance of such a waveplate would be much less sensitive to the direction of propagation, but somewhat more sensitive to temperature, than a typical compound zero-order waveplate.}

  abstract  = {The image formation through a Wollaston prism with large split angle is studied. Formulas for the split angle, approximate calculations of aberrations, and ray tracings are used. The most important aberrations found are astigmatism and anamorphic distortion. Tilting the Wollaston with respect to the incident beam may reduce these aberrations, and if the orientation of the optical axis in the first element is varied it is possible to cancel one of the two aberrations for both images simultaneously, while the other one is substantially reduced. With an adequate adjustment of all the construction parameters the images become sharp enough to allow the use of large split angles ($\sim$15{\textdegree}).}

  abstract  = {In this paper we present the analysis, optimization and implementation of several Stokes polarimeter configurations based on a set-up including two variable retarders. The polarimeter analysis is based on the Mueller-Stokes formalism, and as a consequence, it is suitable to deal with depolarized light. Complete Stokes polarimeters are optimized by minimizing the amplification of simulated errors into the final solution. Different indicators useful to achieve this aim, as the condition number or the equally weighted variance, are compared in this paper. Moreover, some of the optimized polarimeters are experimentally implemented and it is studied the influence of small deviations from the theoretical ones on the amplification of the Stokes component error. In addition, the benefit of using incomplete polarimeters, when detecting specific ranges of states of polarization, is discussed.}
