% Blazars represent a subset of AGN with relativistic jets, where the direction of the jet lies very close to our line of sight. The highly Doppler boosted emission from the blazar's jet results in high apparent luminosities, and blazars display variability on periods from less than one day up to years. At optical wavelengths, the observed emission of the blazar is a superposition of the polarized non-thermal synchrotron emission, arising from the jet, and the non-polarized thermal emission, arising from the accretion disc, broad line region, torus and host galaxy.

% Polarimetry observations can serve as an important tool for diagnosing the emission from blazars. The RSS spectrograph, on SALT, can operate in spectropolarimetry mode and is currently being used to undertake spectropolarimetric observations of transient blazar sources.

% We present additional tools developed to work in conjunction with the current SALT spectropolarimetry reduction pipeline, {\sc polsalt}, that aims to streamline the reduction of the SALT polarization data, including the testing of the wavelength calibration of the individual O and E beams. This was applied to observations of 3C 279 during 2017.

% Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGN) with jets aligned very closely to our line of sight. The optical emission of blazars is often dominated by the polarized, non-thermal emission arising in the jets, with an underlying non-polarized, thermal emission component arising from the host galaxy, dusty torus, and accretion disk components.

% Coupled with multi-wavelength observations, optical spectropolarimetry of blazars during both flaring and quiescent states can be used to disentangle the polarized and non-polarized components in their spectral energy distributions, providing better constraints for the non-thermal particle distribution. To this end, spectropolarimetry of blazars during different states of activity was taken with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS). For RSS spectropolarimetry, reductions are performed using the \textsc{polsalt} pipeline. In order to streamline the spectropolarimetric reductions, we have implemented supplementary interactive tools which provides additional wavelength calibration to improve the accuracy of the wavelength calibration for the O \& E beam.

% Here we present a brief overview of the tools and the results for Hiltner~652, a spectropolarimetric standard, as well as results for the blazars 3C~279. The reduced, $P_{Q}$ and $P_{U}$, Stokes parameters of Hiltner~652 show no major deviation from previously published results which reassures us that there is no interference introduced into the Stokes parameter calculations when wavelength calibrations are handled by our supplementary tools. The $\sim6000 - 9000$ Å range of 3C~279 shows a notable dip in the normalized spectrum during a period of flaring when compared to epochs of enhanced activity. The degree of polarization for 3C~279 of $13.2 \%$, $9.5 \%$, and $21.2 \%$ for the epochs 2017 March 28, 2017 March 31, and 2017 May 17, respectively, remains fairly constant across the observed wavelength ranges while still varying with the blazars' state of quiescence or flaring.
