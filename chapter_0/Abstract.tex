% MARK: Abstract
\begin{abstract}
    % Quick introduction
    % In one or two sentences give the goal of the thesis
    % Summarize the main findings of our results and how that is useful. State what we have done like you have done in Conclusions but only shorter

    \todo{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Done last
            \item Flow from use of SALT and pipeline and basics of its science implementations into why a more streamlined wavelength calibration is an improvement.
            \item Give summary of results.
            \item Aim for a paragraph ($\sim600$) without going too in-depth into anything specific.
            \item Brian's comment: Abstract should summarize paper. Include results, conclusions, etc.
        \end{itemize}
