\begin{abstract}
    % Quick introduction
    % In one or two sentences give the goal of the thesis
    % Summarize the main findings of our results and how that is useful. State what we have done like you have done in Conclusions but only shorter
    
    
    TODO: Done Last... Flow from use of SALT and pipeline and basics of its science implementations into why a more streamlined wavelength calibration is an improvement. Give summary of results. Aim for a paragraph ($\sim600$) without going too in-depth into anything specific.

    Brian comment: Abstract should summarize paper.Include results, conclusions, etc.
    
    % TODO: Add Keywords -> look up the astronomy journal keywords
    \textbf{Key words:} TODO: Look up keywords for pipeline development and data reduction. I.E. Polarisation: optical, Calibration: wavelength, galaxies: AGN, Blazars, Pipeline, SALT, etc.
