\chapter{Science Applications}

\todo{short introduction to chapter contents}

\section{Application to Spectropolarimetric Standards}
\todo{Spectropolarimetric standards (4 highly polarised, 2 non-polarised)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item (Same as ch04 with science results)
        \item Background on objects
        \item Reductions
        \item Actual results - comparison of polsalt results to supplementary pipeline results
        \item Science results, what the results can tell us and why it is useful, also comparison of results to FORS1/2 published data, focus on the polarisation results
    \end{itemize}
}

\section{Application in publications}

\todo{Summary of results from papers in appendix.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Hester paper(s)
        \item Joleen proceedings and work
        \item My proceedings
    \end{itemize}
}

\todo{3C 279 and 4C+01.02
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Give Background on objects, Reduction steps, and Science results (what the results can tell us and why it is useful)
        \item (comparison of polsalt results to supplementary pipeline results will be in testing)
    \end{itemize}
}
