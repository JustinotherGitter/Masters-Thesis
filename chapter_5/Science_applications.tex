TODO: short introduction to chapter contents

\section{Application to Spectropolarimetric Standards}
TODO: Spectropolarimetric standards (4 highly polarised, 2 non-polarised)

- Background on objects

- Reductions

- Actual results - comparison of polsalt results to supplementary pipeline results

- Science results, what the results can tell us and why it is useful, also comparison of results to FORS1/2 published data, focus on the polarisation results

	
\section{Application in publications}

TODO: Summary of results from papers in appendix.

- Hester paper(s)

- Joleen proceedings and work

- My proceedings

TODO: 3C 279 and 4C+01.02

Give Background on objects, Reduction steps, and Science results (what the results can tell us and why it is useful)

(comparison of polsalt results to supplementary pipeline results will be in testing)
