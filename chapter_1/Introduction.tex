\chapter{Introduction}
% 1 Section summary of research. More complete abstract without results.
\todo{
    Very short intro to Spectroscopy, Polarisation, and Spectropolarisation and their Importance in astronomy
}

\todo{
    Problem Statement, \textbf{VERY IMPORTANT}, roughly a sentence but problem thoroughly fleshed out.
}

\todo{
    Focus on AGN implications and implementations such as the types of objects and a short history for each type of object, Blazar focus with specification on BL Lacs and FSRQs, the Unified Model, \sout{The Blazar sequence}
}

\todo{
    Brian's comment: Highlight importance of polarimetry for understanding emission and how that plays a role in AGN.
}

\todo{
    Basics of modelling (Different energy/wavelength ranges used and what the models tell us about emission processes/structure) so that Hester's results can be noted for applications of the pipeline.
}

\todo{
    General layout of Dissertation
