\chapter{Introduction}
% 1 Section summary of research. More complete abstract without results.
TODO: Very short intro to Spectroscopy, Polarisation, and Spectropolarisation and their Importance in astronomy
\prgph

\noindent TODO: Problem Statement, \textbf{VERY IMPORTANT}, roughly a sentence but problem thoroughly fleshed out
\prgph

\noindent Focus on AGN implications and implementations such as the types of objects and a short history for each type of object, Blazar focus with specification on BL Lacs and FSRQs, the Unified Model, \sout{The Blazar sequence}

Brian comment: Highlight importance of polarimetry for understanding emission and how that plays a role in AGN.

Basics of modelling (Different energy/wavelength ranges used and what the models tell us about emission processes/structure) so that Hester's results can be noted for applications of the pipeline.

\noindent TODO: General layout of Dissertation
