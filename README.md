<!-- MARK: VSCode -->
## VSCode

This section contains the setup I've found irreplaceable while writing my thesis in VSCode, or anything useful in general.

<!-- MARK: 1. setup -->
### General setup

1. My Python setup includes the full `Python` and `Jupyter Notebook` extensions as well as the `Black` and `autopep8` formatting extensions.
    * Python must still be installed locally.
1. I use a private GitHub repo, shared with my supervisor, for backing up and version control of my thesis, as well as for my developed software, in a separate repo (goodbye `backup_thesis_(copy)_v1` folders).
    * Look up [`GitHub Education`](https://github.com/education "GitHub Education Homepage") if you are a registered student. It provides both a pro version of GitHub (Private repository advanced features, such as sharing) as well as access to GitHub's Copilot (You're welcome).
1. I use the `Latex Workshop` and the `LTex - LanguageTool grammar/spell chacking` extensions to use $\LaTeX$ in VSCode.
    * $\LaTeX$ must still be installed locally (I use `Tex Live` as recommended by `Latex Workshop`).
1. I use GitHub Copilot for its predictive text and as a first stop for problem shooting as the currently open file is included in its context.
1. I use `markdownlint` for linting Markdown documents.

<!-- MARK: 2. shortcuts -->
### [Useful shortcuts](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks)

<div align=center>

  | Keyboard Shortcut | Use |
  |------------------:|:----|
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>v</kbd> | VSCode View rendered markdown |
  | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> | Open Command Palette |

  |  |  |

</div>

[VSCode] also includes the ability to insert code snippets. I've set up a few frequently used code snippets, but there is, as always, much to be improved upon. See [this file](./.vscode/Writeup_snippets.code-snippets 'My Writeup code snippets') for where to implement them as well as my code snippets.[^vs_snip]

[^vs_snip]: If the relative link breaks due to the `.gitignore` file, see [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets 'Snippets in VSCode') for more information on [VSCode] code snippets.

<!-- MARK: 3. RegEx -->
### Useful RegEx patterns

RegEx allows for complex `find` and `replace` functionality. It may also be used in the VSCode `Search` tab in the primary sidebar (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>)

* `()` represent capture groups in `find` which may be referred to later in `replace` using `$1`, etc.
* `[]` represent character groups in `find`.
* Quantifiers such as `+`, `*`, etc. allow for more complex behavior, especially combined with [greedy and lazy quantifiers](https://javascript.info/regexp-greedy-and-lazy).

Here are some useful RegEx patterns I have needed:

<div align=center>

  | Regex use | Find | Replace |
  |:---------:|-----:|:--------|
  | `John {Smith}` ‚Üí `{Smith}, J.` | `([A-Z])[a-z]*?\s(\{[A-Z].+?\})` | `$2, $1.` |
  | `E. J {Powell}` ‚Üí `{Powell}, E. J.` | `(?<=and\s)([A-Z]\.\|[A-Z]\.\s[A-Z]\.)\s(\{.+?\})` | `$2, $1` |
  | `1 \| 1.1` ‚Üí `$1$ \| $1.1$` | `\s([0-9][\.]*[0-9]*)\s*` | `$$$1$` |
  | `.../:version: ...` ‚Üí `version: ...` | `^[^:]*:\s*` | ` ` |

</div>

I have also made use of `grep` for finding RegEx patterns within files using a CLI:

```console
grep -ri 'version: ' > version.txt
```

where the `r` flag is used for a recursive search in the working directory, and the `i` flag ignores the RegEx case.
Combining this with the [VSCode] \`find and replace', \`delete duplicates', and \`sort lines ascending' results in a sanitized version list of all polsalt/pysalt software.

<!-- MARK: 4. md -->
### Markdown

* <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>

</details>
<br>

This section contains any markdown not used in this document but deemed useful nonetheless.

* Use `[//]: # (Comment)` or `<!-- Comment -->` on a separate line for comments not meant for rendering.
* Use `[^end_text]: A comment that renders as an endnote.`
  * Only works in some Markdown viewers (I.E. GitHub)
* Comments that link to a separate file may link to a specific line within the file using the `#L` suffix.
  * [Thesis.tex line 20 (Hover)](/Thesis.tex#L20 "[Link text](/Thesis.tex#L20 'Hover text')")

<!-- MARK: 5. Tips/Tricks -->
### Tips and Tricks

Here are some general tips and tricks related to VSCode that do not fit neatly into any of the other sections.

* `MARK: Heading` within a comment of a document allows for headings in the VSCode code map, allowing for navigation at a glance.

<!-- MARK: LaTeX Styles -->
## $\LaTeX$ Style guides

<details>
<summary>Useful Links</summary>

* <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX>
* <https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki>
* <https://ashki23.github.io/markdown-latex.html>

</details>
<br>

Included herein are the style guides I have followed during the course of writing my thesis. Custom styles (`my*.sty files`) have been included to both simplify the preamble (located in `Thesis.tex`) and to create a more homogeneous styling throughout when dealing with the relevant packages contained in the style files.

General Notes:

* Inline values with units should be formatted as: `$val$~unit`
  * If the value is a quantifier, consider writing it out
    * i.e. `... 7 filters ...` becomes `... seven filters ...`
* labels are defined using `\label{}`
* Commands may be defined with `\def` but may also be defined using `\newcommand\eg{}`, `\renewcommand\eg{}`, or `\providescommand\eg{}`, which all define new commands that may be used, with differing failure states
  * `\newcommand` crashes when overwriting
  * `\renewcommand` crashes when **not** overwriting, and
  * `\providescommand` attempts to create a new command (I believe exclusively in meta files, I.E. `.sty`, etc.)

<!-- MARK: PRE - hyperref -->
### `hyperref`

$\LaTeX$'s `hyperref` package allows for linking within a PDF as well as setting up the document's metadata properties. The [`hyperref.cfg`](./hyperref.cfg) file is where the metadata is stored.

| Link Types | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `\autoref{label}` | internal reference to `label`, prefixed with (I.E. $\S$, etc.) |
| `\ref{label}` | internal reference to `label`, no prefix text |
| `autopageref{label}` | internal reference to page of `label`, prefixed with (I.E. p.) |
| `\pageref{label}` | internal reference to page of `label`, no prefix text |
| `\href{URL}{text}` | any `URL`'s with anchor `text` |
| `\url{URL}` | any raw `URL` |
| `\hyperref{URL}{category}{name}{text}` | `text` link to `URL` |
| `\hyperref[label]{text}` | `text` link to `label` |

See also the documentation using: `texdoc hyperref`

<!-- MARK: PRE - glossary -->
### Glossary and Acronyms

$\LaTeX$'s `glossaries-extra` allow keywords and acronyms to be defined and used and stated in full on first use. Note that acronyms used for software use a display text in the small caps font.

```Latex
% Glossary entries
\newglossaryentry{maths}
{%
    name=mathematics,
    description={Mathematics is what mathematicians do}
}

\gls{maths} -> mathematics
\Gls{maths} -> Mathematics
\glspl{maths} -> mathematics
\Glspl{maths} -> Mathematics

% Acronym entries
\newacronym{gcd}{GCD}{Greatest Common Divisor}

\acrlong{} -> Greatest Common Divisor
\acrshort{} -> GCD
\acrfull{} -> Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
```

New commands for the most common glossary/acronym keys may improve 'writability' (`\acr{POLSALT}` vs `\polsalt`). This was implemented for all software acronyms. See also the documentation using: `texdoc glossaries-extra`

<!-- MARK: 1. Headings -->
### Headings

My headings use `Title Case`.[^head_case] Generally, labels are only included when necessary and are not compulsory when creating a new section, etc.

```Latex
% Note case is `Title Case`
\chapter{Chapter Title}
\section{Section Title} \label{sec:sec_title}
\dots
```

[^head_case]: `Sentence case` may also be used, just stick to whichever style is chosen.

<!-- MARK: 2. Equations -->
### Equations

Equations are written in-text and are a part of sentences unless otherwise indicated. To this end, there is no new line before `\begin` or after `\end` (unless the sentence ends with the equation and the equation is punctuated) and multiple equations in a single environment are properly punctuated.

**Note**: multi-line, or continued, equations are aligned by the `=` symbol while related equations within one environment are aligned by centering.

```Latex
% Align center
\begin{equation} \label{eq:name}
    eq \,[,|.]
\end{equation}

% Align center, ignore end text
\begin{equation} \label{eq:name}
    \begin{gathered}
        eq1 = ... \,,\\
        eq2 = ... \rlap{\,,\ and}\\
        eq3 = ...
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

% Align by `=', ignore end text
\begin{equation} \label{eq:name}
    \begin{aligned}
      eq1 &= ... \,,\\
      eq2 &= ... \rlap{\,,\ and}\\
      eq3 &= ...
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
```

See references (Wikibooks) for more configurations of equations.

<!-- MARK: 3. Figures -->
### Figures

Figures are located in their relevant chapter (`chapter_*/figures/`) and have the chapter number, $i$, prepended to their name (`<i>_<name>.[pdf|svg]`).

The figures included in the document are `pdf`'s, but it is useful to save a copy of self-generated figures as `svg`'s for when edits to the figure will naturally arise. See 'Custom Figures' for further constraints on generated figures. [FITS] images are also saved as `pdf`, but may have a lower `dpi` as compared to other figures when not much detail is needed for the figure.

To use the figures in the $\LaTeX$ document, use:

```Latex
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{'<i>_<name>.[pdf|png]'}
    \caption{Include a suitable caption here. Figure (if cited: 'adapted from', if own: 'created using') 'source'.(if link: \protect\footnotemark)}
    \label{fig:'suitable_label'}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{\protect\url{(link)}}
```

or, for sub-figures, use:

```Latex
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{fig1.extension}
        \caption{fig1 caption}
        \label{subfig:fig1_label}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width = 1.0\textwidth]{fig2.extension}
        \caption{fig2 caption}
        \label{subfig:fig2_label}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Overall caption}
    \label{fig:fig_caption}
\end{figure}
```

#### Custom Figures

Figures created by myself are (generally) made using Inkscape. To keep line widths / text size / etc. consistent the following document properties are used:

* Document properties
  * $6.28$ ($160mm$) x ? inches
    * $x$-size set to the $\LaTeX$ `\textwidth` (usually in inches)
      * (`\textwidth` found by using `\the\textwidth` anywhere in the $\LaTeX$ document)
      * $6.28$ inches == $A4$ page with uniform $1$ inch border.
    * $y$-size depends on figure aspect ratio, usually left undefined
  * Before saving, use `resize to content` (if no text included in custom figure)
  * scale = $0.1$

* Grid properties
  * $s_x$, $s_y$ = $1$ mm
  * Major Grid every $5$

* Fill properties
  * Lightness = $66$
  * (I.E. $0$, $0$, $66$, $100$)

* Font properties
  * `CMU Serif` for text
  * `CMU Serif Italics` for symbols
  * weight = normal
  * size = $12$ pt

* Stroke properties
  * width = $1$ px

See also: <https://jwalton.info/Matplotlib-latex-PGF/>

Figures are first saved as an `svg` before being exported as either a `png` or `pdf` to 'play well' with the $\LaTeX$ `\includegraphics[]{}` command.

<!-- MARK: TikZ -->
#### $TikZ$ Figures

<details>
<summary>Useful Links</summary>

* <https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/LaTeX_Graphics_using_TikZ%3A_A_Tutorial_for_Beginners_(Part_3)%E2%80%94Creating_Flowcharts>

</details>
<br>

$TikZ$ refers to the `tikz` package (which may include libraries) which can generate figures and diagrams, etc. The relevant preamble commands are:

```Latex
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{shapes.geometric, arrows} % specifically for flowcharts
```

The preamble must also include the definitions of any required `tikzstyle` definitions. Styles may include nodes and lines:

```Latex
\tikzstyle{ends} = [rectangle, draw, text centered, rounded corners, minimum height=2em]
\tikzstyle{step} = [rectangle, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em]
\tikzstyle{choice} = [diamond, draw, text centered, minimum height=2em]
\tikzstyle{data}=[trapezium, draw, text centered, trapezium left angle=60, trapezium right angle=120, minimum height=2em]
\tikzstyle{to} = [draw, -latex']
```

and may be included in a document using:

```Latex
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \node (name) [type, right of=(name), below of=(name), xshift=2cm, yshift=2cm] {text};
        \draw [to] (name_from) -- (name_to);
        \draw [arrow] (name_from) -- node[anchor=east] {yes} (name_to_yes);
        \draw [arrow] (name_from) -- node {no} (name_to_no);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{File caption}
    \label{fig:file_label}
\end{figure}
```

<!-- MARK: 4. Tables -->
### Tables

Tables can be generated using a [$\LaTeX$ Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/). Tables are located in their relevant chapter (`chapter_*/tables/`) and have the chapter number, $i$, prepended to their name (`<i>_<name>.tex`). The contents of the file are structured similar to:

```Latex
\begin{table}[t]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c(* the amount of columns)}
        ...
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{A suitable caption and relevant reference.\protect\footnotemark}
    \label{table:'suitable_label'}
\end{table}
\footnotetext{Link or further description of reference or discussion of footnotemark in text.}
```

To insert a table within the document, use the command:

```Latex
\input{chapter_<i>/tables/table_name.tex}
```
